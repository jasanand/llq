C++ multithreaded lock less queue implementation of both un-bounded (fifo)
and bounded (circular) queues where multiple dummy exchange objects enqueue 
trades and their strategy objects deque them.

We can have multiple producers (exchanges) to consumers (strategies) sinks as
shown in the demo.

Requirements:

The setup requires google benchmark packages to be installed and assumes
C++ 20 compiler to be present to build the code.
For google benchmark: google...

Makefile Targets:

all: default target which has queue semantics mentioned above
benchmark: uses google benchmark to benchmark the program
